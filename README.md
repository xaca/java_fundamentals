## How to install an IDE
First off, what is an IDE? An IDE is a place for coders to change the code of the program they're
working on. From the tiniest of projects to the largest you will need an IDE, which one you choose is up to you. For this tutorial we will be using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org), but there are plenty of other choices.

### Download the IDE
Go to the [Eclipse website](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Eclipse. Currently, this is Eclipse Oxygen.

### Run through the setup
1) Click "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers", this will install the IDE, a git (version control) client, and a couple of other editors for advanced Java development.
2) Change the install path (if you want to), click install, and then accept the terms and conditions.

### Open Eclipse
1) Launch Eclipse. Click 'Launch' when the program asks about a directory for the workspace.
2) Click 'File' -> 'New' -> 'Java Project'. Enter a name for your project, and click 'Finish'.
3) Right click on your project in the left pane, choose 'New', and select 'Class'. Name it 'Main'.
4) Click 'Finish' and you're done! You can now do all of the examples in this repository!

#### Other way to work with java without using IDE

1.Download java jdk from the website install it in the host machine and install the path.
2.Download a text editor(Sublime,Atom,etc) and start writing the code.
3.open terminal go to the folder where your java code is saved and compile the file using the command javac classname.java.
4.After succesfully compiling the code java will create a class file with name classname.class.
5.Next step is to execute the file in the terminal,command for executing is java classname.
6.Boom!! there is your output "Hello world!".
