## How to install an IDE
First off what is an IDE? An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a place for coders to change the code of the program they're working on. From the tiniest of projects to the largest you will need an IDE, which one you choose is up to you. For this tutorial we will be using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org), but there are plenty of other choices.

### Download the IDE
Go to the [Eclipse downloads](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) page and download the most up-to-date version of Eclipse. At the time of this readme it is Eclipse Oxygen.

### Run through the setup
1. Click **Eclipse IDE for Java Developers**. This will install the IDE, a git (version control) client and a couple of other editors for advanced Java development.
2. Change the install path (if you want to), then click install and accept the terms and conditions.

### Open Eclipse
1. Launch Eclipse like launching other programs (e.g. on Windows open the start menu and search for Eclipse). Click **launch** when asked about a workspace.
2. Click **File -> New**. Create a new Java project with any name, then click **Finish**.
3. Right click on your project in the left pane, hover over new, and select **class**. Name it "Main".
4. Click **finish** and there you go! You can now do all of the examples in this repository!
