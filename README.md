## How to install an IDE
First off what is an IDE? An IDE is a place for coders to change the code of the program they're
working on. From the tiniest of projects to the largest you will need an IDE, which one you choose is up to you. For this tutorial we will be using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org), but there are plenty of other choices.

### Download the IDE
Step one is to go to the [download](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) link provided, and download the most up to date version of eclipse, at the time of this readme it is Eclipse Oxygen

### Run through the setup
1) Click "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers", this will install the IDE, a git (version control) client, and a couple of other editors for advanced Java development
2) Change the install path (if you want to), click install, and then accept the terms and conditions

### Open Eclipse
1) Launch eclipse however you launch other programs (on windows by opening the start menu and searching for eclipse), then click launch when asked about a workspace.
2) Click file -> new and then name a new project whatever you want, then click finish
3) Right click on your project in the left pane, hover over new, and select class. Name it "Main".
4) Click finish and there you go! You can now do all of the examples in this repository!
